## Notes

<!-- Describe any challenges encountered while building the app. -->

- Getting the hero image, along with the gradient transition, added on approximately 3 hours to the project - half of which was spent looking up how to do it and the other half was me being a perfectionist.
- I had a hard time getting the total amount of underfunded games, even though it seemed like it would be an easy JavaScript for loop. As a result, the code may look janky and unprofessional.
- Another hard thing was designing the UI/UX for the site. I do not have any certifications in UI/UX design, but I still tried my best to make this site stand out from the crowd in an effort to learn all I can about CSS.
- The hardest part was learning/relearning the many JavaScript functions that I used.
